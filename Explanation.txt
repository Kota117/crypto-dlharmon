   As documented in the python file, getTransactionInfo.py provides transaction
information for a given transaction id. A proxy is created using the Testnet
port and the bitcoin.conf configuration file we created for bitcoind. There is
a default transaction id provided that corresponds to the first testcoin that
I recieved from the faucet bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net. However, when run,
getTransactionInfo.py can take an input of a transaction id to gather information
for other transactions associated with my wallet; only transactoins associated
with my wallet have the information stored and accessible to me. Next, there 
is a check done to see whether the default id or a user inputted id should
be used. The inforamtion is gathered and then printed to the screen.
